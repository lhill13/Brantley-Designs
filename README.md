# Brantley-Designs
The whole purpose of this website is to showcase Megan's talents and sell work that people can enjoy around their houses. 

Megan and I worked well as a team. Most of the desing aspects were left up to her while I dealt more with the logistics. I created the code for the navbar as well as every link within the page. I also created the slideshow and got the video on the about page placed and working. She chose the color scheme and most of the background images and wrote all of the blog posts and paragraphs for the page. I was the only person who worked on the Contact me page, and she was the only one who worked on the main blog page. We worked to together on every other page. While she finished up some of the design aspects of the pages, I began responsive design and completed most of the by myself.

There were a couple of times that we logged in and everything on the site was messed up. The first time was simply due to a labeling problem, but we never figured out the second time. As a result, some of the responsive is still a little off. We had to completely erase two days worth of code and were unable to redo it before submitting the site. 

I tried really hard to remove any horizontal scroll bars but never could figure out exactly what was causing the space. If you notice something, please let me know so that I can fix it. Also, there were a couple of pages that, once I began working on responsive, the background image would no longer go all the way to the bottom. I tried making the image height and width 100% and using background-size: cover, but neither worked. 

This website is responsive to iphone 6+, Ipad Air 2, most laptop sizes, and the extrawide desktops at SHHS. While it does not appear perfectly on other devices, it should still be able to be viewed correctly and without too much hastle.
